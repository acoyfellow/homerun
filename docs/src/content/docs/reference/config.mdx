## alchemy.run.ts

unsurf uses [Alchemy](https://alchemy.run) to define infrastructure as TypeScript. No YAML. No TOML.

<SourceCode file="alchemy.run.ts" />

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ALCHEMY_PASSWORD` | ✅ | Encrypts Alchemy's local state file. Set any strong passphrase; changing it invalidates existing state. |
| `ALCHEMY_STATE_TOKEN` | | Cloudflare API token scoped to Alchemy's remote state store (`CloudflareStateStore`). When set, state is persisted remotely instead of on disk — required for CI deploys. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | ✅ | Cloudflare API token with **Workers, D1, R2, and Browser Rendering** permissions. Used by Alchemy to provision resources. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | ✅ | Your Cloudflare account ID. Found at the top of the Cloudflare dashboard. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | | Anthropic API key. Passed as a secret binding to the worker for LLM-guided scouting. Without it, scout falls back to heuristic-only mode. |
| `ALCHEMY_STAGE` | | Deployment stage (`production` by default). Set to a different value to deploy an isolated copy (e.g. `staging`, `dev`). |

Set these in a `.env` file at the project root or export them in your shell before running `bun run deploy`.

## Cloudflare bindings

These are configured automatically by Alchemy:

| Binding | Type | Name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DB` | D1 Database | `unsurf-db` | Stores sites, endpoints, paths, run history |
| `STORAGE` | R2 Bucket | `unsurf-storage` | Stores HAR logs, screenshots, traces |
| `BROWSER` | Browser Rendering | — | Headless browser for scouting |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Secret | — | Passed through as an encrypted secret binding (only when the env var is set) |

## Database schema

unsurf uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) with Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). Migrations are applied automatically by Alchemy on deploy — no manual migration steps are needed.

<SourceCode file="src/db/schema.ts" />

### `sites`

One row per distinct website that has been scouted.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `text` PK | Unique site identifier (e.g. `site_lx1a_k9m3`) |
| `url` | `text` | The URL that was passed to `scout` |
| `domain` | `text` | Extracted hostname — used for grouping and deduplication |
| `first_scouted_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | Timestamp of the first scout |
| `last_scouted_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | Timestamp of the most recent scout |

### `endpoints`

Every unique API call observed during scouting. A site has many endpoints. Endpoints are deduplicated by the composite unique index `(site_id, method, path_pattern)`.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `text` PK | Unique endpoint identifier |
| `site_id` | `text` FK → `sites.id` | The site this endpoint belongs to |
| `method` | `text` | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) |
| `path_pattern` | `text` | URL path with parameter placeholders (e.g. `/api/v1/users/:id`) |
| `request_schema` | `text` (JSON) | JSON Schema of the request body, inferred from observed traffic |
| `response_schema` | `text` (JSON) | JSON Schema of the response body |
| `request_headers` | `text` (JSON) | Notable request headers (auth tokens, content types) |
| `response_headers` | `text` (JSON) | Notable response headers |
| `sample_count` | `integer` | How many times this endpoint was observed (higher = more confident schema) |
| `first_seen_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | When this endpoint was first captured |
| `last_seen_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | When this endpoint was last captured |

### `paths`

A replayable sequence of steps that accomplishes a task on a site. Created by `scout`, executed by `worker`, repaired by `heal`. A site can have many paths; each path references one or more endpoints.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `text` PK | Unique path identifier (returned as `pathId`) |
| `site_id` | `text` FK → `sites.id` | The site this path belongs to |
| `task` | `text` | The natural-language task passed to `scout` |
| `steps` | `text` (JSON array) | Ordered list of HTTP calls to replay |
| `endpoint_ids` | `text` (JSON array) | IDs of the endpoints this path touches |
| `status` | `text` | `active`, `broken`, or `healing` |
| `created_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | When the path was created |
| `last_used_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | When `worker` last executed this path |
| `fail_count` | `integer` | Consecutive failures (reset to 0 on success) |
| `heal_count` | `integer` | Total number of successful heals |

### `runs`

Audit log of every tool invocation — scout, worker, and heal. Used for debugging, monitoring, and billing.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `text` PK | Unique run identifier |
| `path_id` | `text` FK → `paths.id` | The path this run relates to (null for scout runs on new sites) |
| `tool` | `text` | Which tool ran: `scout`, `worker`, or `heal` |
| `status` | `text` | `success` or `failure` |
| `input` | `text` (JSON) | The full input passed to the tool |
| `output` | `text` (JSON) | The tool's result (null on failure) |
| `error` | `text` | Error message (null on success) |
| `duration_ms` | `integer` | Wall-clock time of the run |
| `har_key` | `text` | R2 object key for the HAR recording (scout runs only) |
| `created_at` | `text` (ISO 8601) | When the run started |

### Relationships

```
sites 1─┬─∞ endpoints
        └─∞ paths 1──∞ runs
```

- A **site** has many **endpoints** (all API calls observed) and many **paths** (replayable task sequences).
- A **path** belongs to one site and references specific endpoints via `endpoint_ids`.
- A **run** belongs to one path and records a single tool invocation.

## REST API

The worker exposes a JSON REST API alongside the MCP endpoint.

### `GET /`

Health check and service metadata.

**Response** `200`
```json
{
  "name": "unsurf",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "description": "Turn any website into a typed API",
  "tools": ["scout", "worker", "heal"],
  "mcp": "/mcp",
  "docs": "https://unsurf.coey.dev"
}
```

### `POST /tools/scout`

Explore a website and capture its API endpoints.

**Request body**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "task": "find the user search endpoint"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | `string` | ✅ | Target URL to scout |

}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `{"error": "Missing 'url' and 'task' in request body"}` | Required fields missing |
| `500` | `{"error": "..."}` | Browser, network, or storage failure |

### `POST /tools/worker`

Replay a scouted path — executes the captured API calls directly, no browser needed.

**Request body**
```json
{
  "pathId": "path_lx1a_q7z2",
  "data": { "query": "alice" }
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |

}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `{"error": "Missing 'pathId' in request body"}` | Required field missing |
| `500` | `{"error": "PathBrokenError: POST /api/v1/users returned 404"}` | Path is broken — call heal |
| `500` | `{"error": "..."}` | Network or storage failure |

### `POST /tools/heal`

Repair a broken path by retrying, then re-scouting if retries fail.

**Request body**
```json
{
  "pathId": "path_lx1a_q7z2",
  "error": "POST /api/v1/users returned 404"
}
```

|---|---|---|---|
| `pathId` | `string` | ✅ | ID of the broken path |
| `error` | `string` | | Description of what went wrong — helps the re-scout |

**Response** `200`
```json
{
  "healed": true,
  "newPathId": "path_mx2b_r8a1"
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `{"error": "Missing 'pathId' in request body"}` | Required field missing |
| `500` | `{"error": "..."}` | Browser, network, or storage failure |

### `POST /mcp`

MCP (Streamable HTTP) endpoint. See [MCP Server guide](/guides/mcp) and [MCP Tools reference](/reference/tools).

### CORS

All endpoints return permissive CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`). `OPTIONS` preflight requests are handled automatically.

### Unknown routes

Any other method/path combination returns `404`:

```json
{ "error": "Not found" }
```
